(define (textA "The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union and the Jaccard similarity coefficient (originally given the French name coefficient de communauté by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used for gauging the similarity and diversity of sample sets. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets."))
(define (textB "The Jaccard similarity index (sometimes called the Jaccard similarity coefficient) compares members for two sets to see which members are shared and which are distinct. It’s a measure of similarity for the two sets of data, with a range from 0% to 100%. The higher the percentage, the more similar the two populations. Although it’s easy to interpret, it is extremely sensitive to small samples sizes and may give erroneous results, especially with very small samples or data sets with missing observations."))

(define (textC "In information theory, linguistics and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. It is named after the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who considered this distance in 1965. Levenshtein distance may also be referred to as edit distance, although that term may also denote a larger family of distance metrics. It is closely related to pairwise string alignments."))

(define (textG "President Trump slammed Chicago’s police superintendent for skipping his speech in protest at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in the Chicago. “There is one person that’s not here today. I said, ‘Where is he, I want to talk to him. In fact, more than anyone else, this person should be here because maybe he could learn something. And that’s the superintendent of Chicago Police chief Eddie Johnson,” the president said in the Windy City. “A few days ago, Johnson said quote, ‘The values of the people of Chicago are more important than anything President Trump could have decided.’ I don’t think so. Because it’s a very insulting statement,” Trump told the crowd, who’d been fired up as “Macho Man” blared from the McCormick Place ballroom speakers just before he spoke. “After all I’ve done, and I’ve done more than any other president. Here’s a man that could not bother to show up for a meeting of police chiefs, the most respected people, in his hometown. And with the president of the United States.” “And you know why, it’s because he’s not doing his job. Last year, 565 people were murdered in Chicago. Since Eddie Johnson has been policing, more than 1,500 people have been murdered in Chicago and 13,067 people have been shot. During the first weekend of August 2019, seven people were murdered.”He also pointed to Chicago’s tough gun laws, asserting that they did not good, though most weapons police confiscate are purchased elsewhere."))
(define (textH "President Trump tore into Chicago’s top cop on Monday at a law enforcement conference in the city, blasting Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson for soaring violent crime rates and accusing him of putting "criminals and illegal aliens" before Windy City residents. The series of broadsides from the commander-in-chief came after Johnson boycotted the president’s speech at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago. Trump went after Johnson at length -- going so far as to suggest he should be replaced while describing the city as more dangerous than Afghanistan -- before diving into his prepared remarks. “People like Johnson put criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of Chicago,” Trump said. “Those are his values and, frankly, those values to me are a disgrace.”Chicago is a "sanctuary city" where local authorities do not cooperate with federal immigration officials, denying information that would help them deport people living in the U.S. illegally. Proponents say Chicago's efforts encourage cooperation between local police and immigrant communities.Trump, who has long been a critic of Chicago’s policies dating back to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s time in office, was in the city to, among other things, sign an executive order establishing the Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. But he repeatedly slammed Johnson for the city’s rampant gun violence, while saying rank-and-file officers deserve a leader who has their backs and "who sides with you." "It's embarrassing to us as a nation," Trump said. "All over the world they're talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison."Trump specifically called out Johnson for failing to tackle the city’s high murder rate. “He’s not doing his job,” Trump said. “565 people were murdered last year.” The actual number is slightly higher as a Chicago Tribune analysis found that 573 people were killed in the city in 2018. That number, however, is lower than the 675 people killed in 2017 and much lower than the 795 people killed in 2016 – the year Johnson took the helm of the Chicago Police Department. The murder rate in Chicago for 2018 was still much higher than the combined number of homicides in America's two largest cities, New York and Los Angeles. As of about mid-December last year, New York reported 278 homicides and Los Angeles 243. Johnson, who attended a number of other events at the conference, told local media in Chicago that his decision not to attend Trump’s speech was because of “personal feelings.”"))
